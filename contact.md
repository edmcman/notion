# Contact

We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/raboof/notion/issues) and
pull requests for code contribution.

For discussion about the future of the project, we use issues tagged "enhancement".

For support questions and notion related chat such as quickly asking a question,
we use IRC:
#notion on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat).

Please don't hesitate to get in touch! If no-one happens to be around on IRC,
feel free to create a GitHub issue.

## Mailing list archive

There is a [mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/notion/mailman/notion-devel/)
on sourceforge, but ever since the project has migrated to GitHub, it is no
longer very active. It does however provide a view into the past, and may answer
some questions if you're willing to dig.
